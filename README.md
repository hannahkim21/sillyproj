# sillyproj
This is my first personal side project. I made this to practice version control and doing things from scratch.
It is a translator to Pig Latin from the standard input, string, or file.
It then prints the resulting translation.

Possible improvements: <br>
    Write output to file <br>
    Handle weirder-case inputs
